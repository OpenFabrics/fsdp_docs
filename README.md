Documentation for the OpenFabrics Fabric Software Development Platform (FSDP)

## Lab Usage

The lab is available to members of the Open Fabrics Alliance, to support the
development and mainteance of fabric drivers and software, as well as the
upstream activities, such as the Linux Kernel.

Usage of the lab is doverned by an [Acceptable Usage Policy](AUP.md)

## Lab Access

External users will connect to the lab and the systems hosted therein over an
openVPN connection.  Once connected, the networks shown below are available to
the user directly over the VPN.  

Unless ohterwise noted, users should have access to each system (test nodes, PDUs,
etc.) in the lab via either their SSH key, or their password.  We are, to the
extend possible, avoiding the use of any shared or published credentials for the
systems.

## Lab Logical Network Layout

The figure below shows the general layout of the lab network.  The [Lab Network
Information](network_information.md) page provides additional information about
the lab systems, including lists of host names, etc.
