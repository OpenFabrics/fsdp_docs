# Acceptable Usage Policy

The official [OpenFabrics Alliance FSDP Acceptable Use Policy](https://downloads.openfabrics.org/WorkGroups/fsdpwg/FSDP%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy%20v1.0.docx)
is the authoritative source for OFA enforced guidelines.  Anything present
in this file is in addition to those OFA guidelines.  In the event of a
conflict between the OFA FSDP AUP and this document, the default will be
to consider the more restrictive document to prevail.

## Resource Usage

Per the OFA FSDP AUP, access to the FSDP by members is unlimited, however
member access can not block resources indefinitely.  Extended usage that
prevents the upstream Continuous Integration testing from running, or
periods of time where the member keeps machines checked out and otherwise
unavailable but is not actually making use of them (camping), or periods
of time where the member uses so many of the machines that other members
are blocked from access (hogging) are all justification for system admins
to return the member's reservations and allow either automated job queues
or manual checkouts by other members to proceed.  Full discretion is given
to the FSDP Working Group to decide when such actions are justified and
necessary.

## VPN Access

Users access to the FSDP Lab resources is provided through an openvpn
connection. VPN accounts are provided to approved lab users, meeting the
requirements set forth by the OFA.  Users may not share their VPN
credentials with others. Sharing of VPN credentials will result in permanent
loss of access to the lab.

## Network Bandwidth

Available bandwidth to the Internet is limited and shared across all lab
users. Downloading excessively large files can interfere with other users
therefore as a courtesy the lab admin should be informed if users intend
to download very large files or consume substantial bandwidth for any
duration.

## Remote Console Access

Users are provided with access to the remote console access and ipmi power
management of each test server in the lab. Causing or intending to cause
any damage or configuration change to the BIOS of the hosted servers will
result in permanent loss of access to the Community Lab resources. Changing
or creating any IPMI user credentials is strictly prohibited and could result
in termination of lab access.  Remote console and power management rights may
be changed or removed at the OFA's or UNH-IOLâ€™s discretion, as necessary to
protect the integrity of the lab and its systems.

## Support

One site lab support is provided during normal business hours (assuming USA
East Coast time zone).  Support outside of those hours is limited ot best effort
basis only. Support requests may take up to 1 business day to be completed,
depending on the request.  For support, please contact ofa-lab@iol.unh.edu.

Any voliation of this Acceptable USage Policy may result in loss of access
to the FSDP Lab resources.
