therefore as a courtesy the lab admin should be informed if users intend

duration.

management of each test server in the lab. Causing or intending to cause

or creating any IPMI user credentials is strictly prohibited and could result
in termination of lab access.  Remote console and power management rights may
be changed or removed at the OFA's or UNH-IOLâ€™s discretion, as necessary to
protect the integrity of the lab and its systems.
